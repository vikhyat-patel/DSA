Optimal solution - O(N) & O(1), but try explaining the brute soln at first then jump to this optimal one..
Brute soln will be to check from every petrol pump from start, and return the first valid from which we can make a circular tour..will work in (N^2)  


struct petrolPump
{
    int petrol;
    int distance;
};

    //Function to find starting point where the truck can start to get through the complete circle without exhausting its petrol in between..

    int tour(petrolPump p[],int n)
    {
        int petrol_sum = 0;
        int distance_sum = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            petrol_sum += p[i].petrol;
            distance_sum += p[i].distance;
        }
        if(petrol_sum < distance_sum){        // base case
            return -1;
        }
        
        int ptr = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int carry_petrol = 0;
        
        while(i < n){
            
           carry_petrol += p[i].petrol - p[i].distance;
           
           if(carry_petrol < 0){
               ptr = i + 1;
               carry_petrol = 0;
           }
           i++;
        }
        return ptr;
    }
