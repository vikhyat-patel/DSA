1. Count Distinct elements in every window [simple unordered_map concept SLw concept]

2. Max Sum Subarray of size K [simple o(n) & o(1) solution]

3. Largest subarray of 0's and 1's [simple unordered_map + SLw concept, Convert all the 0's to -1, thus the problem reduces to find the length of largest subarray giving sum 0]

4. Smallest window containing 0, 1 and 2 [simple, unordered_map concept, o(n) & o(n) concept with use of SLw]

5. Maximum sum of subarray less than or equal to x [simple o(n) & o(1) solution, with window slide 2 ptrs]
