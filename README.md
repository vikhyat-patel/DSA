Some important questions for software interviews. Check out the following ones also!

1. Search in a matrix - {Two pointer}
2. Number of 1 Bits - {very very interesting, must look}
3. Parenthesis checker - {stack}
4. Sort a stack - {recursion}, Special stack {simple implementation}
5. Queue using 2 stacks & Stack using 2 queues - {Imp ques, see Yt video}
6. Subarray with ZERO sum - {Prefix sum & Hashing, easy}
7. Subarray with given sum - {Sliding Window approach}
8. Kadane's algo & its variations - {Very IMP}
9. Jump Game - {max_reach concept, easy}
10. Maximum product subarray - {2 way KADANE, easy}
11. Minimum number of jumps - {Tricky ques, {max_reach, steps, jumps}} - Must Look this!
12. Majority Element - {moore's voting algorithm}
13. Find duplicates in the array - {a beautiful logic with constant space}
14. Find Kth smallest element in an array - {priority_queue(max heap), must look} - (similar for Kth largest)
15. Peak Element - {a very beautiful concept of 'BS' with edge cases, must look}
16. Minimize the heights - {a very Tricky ques, revise it GFG}
17. Count pairs with given sum - {use of 'Map' to keep the count of freq}
18. Rotate an array by 'd' places - {use of 3 times reverse function)
19. Minimum Platforms - {sorting arrival & departure, and 2 pointer approach, Must look}
20. Stock Span Problem - {standard stack ques, use of stack<pair>, must look}
21. DP on STOCKS - {very very IMP} - [atmost k transactions,, cooldown,, transaction fee,, valley peak] - Refer 'Leetcode' MUST DO!
22. Maximum of all subarrays of size k - {'Sliding window' technique, very very IMP & Tricky, must look, Gfg}
23. Spirally traversing a matrix - {very tricky Implementation, frequently asked, must revise this, Gfg} - (Top = 0, bottom = r - 1, left = 0, right = c - 1)
24. Remove duplicate elements from sorted Array - {In place, 'TWO Pointer technique'}
25. Intersection/ Union of arrays - {Hashing, unordered_set}
26. (IMP) House Robber (I & II) Questions - {standard 'DP' problems, must look Leetcode}
27. 'Count Inversions' & Print Kth smallest/largest, find kth smallest/largest - {Priority_queue(max/min Heap), look above Github file}
28. House Robber, Jump Game & Pascals Triangle - {IMP Ques, refer Leetcode, must do}
29. 'The Celebrity Problem' - {Two pointer approach, a = 0, b = n - 1, checking the candidate of celebrity}
30. Max Sum without Adjacents - {A very very tricky Ques, use of variables (val 1 = arr[0], val 2 = arr[1]) to find the max_sum, corner cases, must look}
