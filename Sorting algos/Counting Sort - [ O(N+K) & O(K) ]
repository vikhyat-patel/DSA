1. We keep the count of occurence of the elements in the array.
2. if we know the range of elements that is, if we know the maximum value of all the elements, then it is the value of k. 
3. we have to make a freq array of size 'k' to make sure we keep the count of all elements present in the array.
4. after that we can iterate over the freq array & store the answer according to their 'counts' in a suitable data structure.


class Solution{
    public:
    //Function to arrange all letters of a string in lexicographical 
    //order using Counting Sort.
    string countSort(string arr){
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);   // here k is 26
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            freq[arr[i]-'a']++;
        }
        string ans="";
        for(int i=0;i<26;i++){
           if(freq[i] == 0)
           continue;
           int cnt = freq[i];
           while(cnt != 0){
              char ch = char(i + 'a'); 
              ans += ch; 
              cnt--; 
           }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
